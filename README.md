##  Group Project

### Delivery Instructions
After completing the assignment, you are to submit a zip file containing all the source code and documentation to your group project solution. Include a read me file that has a link to the assignment on the server with any necessary credentials to log into the server. Additionally, the file should contain links to any resources (backgrounds, images, graphics, etc) that you found on the Internet that were used in this assignment.

### Folder Structure
1. **http://server/~group/cop4813/index.php** – Initial page of the group project.


### Assignment Specifications
The group project will require you to work within a team‐environment to create a functional, interactive, data‐driven website for a specific purpose. You are encouraged to select a small project with clear scope to minimize scope creep and make the project attainable. Do not take on something too difficult to accomplish as you will be evaluated on completeness of your final product as part of the evaluation process. The project must meet the following guidelines:


1.  The project must make use of W3C valid HTML with appropriate graphics/pictures and valid tags. The project will be submitted to a markup validation service to check. For instance,
    one might use http://validator.w3.org/. (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
2.  The project must make use of Cascading Style All the style sheet commands should conform to the appropriate syntax. You are encouraged to link to the CSS file externally, but you
    can also use inline and embedded commands.
3.  The project must make use of appropriate JavaScript commands for client‐side. The JavaScript should be meaningfully and seamlessly integrated into the site with purpose. You are
    discouraged from using alert or confirmation boxes unless absolutely necessary.
4.  The project must make use of an existing software library (e.g., jQuery). You should seek to integrate the software library seamlessly into your final solution.
5.  The project must make use of appropriate PHP server‐side commands to create a dynamic and data‐driven user experience. The PHP command must make use of sessions to create
    extended interactions with the user.
6.  The project must make use of a database using MySQL. The database structure should include at least one one‐to‐many relationship and must include at least one join operation
    as a query. The database should be pre‐populated with dummy data to enhance the user experience.

### Group Project Proposal
Your group will be required to create a functional, interactive, data‐driven website for a specific purpose. For instance, you might create a Blog or a shopping cart or a movie gallery or rating system or a site with a social purpose for a local not‐for‐profit organization. Regardless, you must submit a group project proposal to the instructor on the designated due date. This group project proposal should outline the following information in one page: 1) team members, and 2) description of site (small scope statement), and 3) name of site or application. Do not take on more than you can accomplish. If you need assistance selecting a good topic, please have a conversation with the instructor prior to the group project proposal due date.

## Showcase of Website
In the final class meeting, we will showcase the different applications that were developed to our peers and the instructor. You will need to bring a laptop with an Internet connection to the showcase on UNF’s campus. There will be a rating system in place. The group project that receives the highest rating from the class will automatically receive a 100% on the group project. The date for the showcase can be found on the course schedule on the syllabus.

### Documentation Requirements
All groups are required to provide basic software documentation for their website. This includes 1) a basic user manual on how to use the website, and 2) an entity‐relationship diagram (ERD) that illustrates the database structure. This information is vital to the final project, so please take it seriously.

 ### Grading Rubric
